Your next assignment will be to find the maximum element in a vector of
900000000 floats. Still 900 million, but this time floats! Your program
should...

- Allocate the memory needed to store 900 million numbers and initialize
the memory with random numbers between 0 and 1. Hint: it is faster to
initialize the vector on the GPU.

- Find the index and the value of the largest number using the GPU and
the CPU.

- Output the index and the value found on the GPU and the CPU for
comparison.

- Print a comprehensive log to the command line stating the runtimes of
different sections of your program.
