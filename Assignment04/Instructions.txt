From Assignment 03, output gave visibility graph. 
For polygons_indoor, polygons_small and polygons_large, 
visibility graphs are computed and named vg_indoor.txt, vg_small.txt and vg_large.txt respectively (stored in Assignment03 directory).
That is input for Assignment 04.

If you want to change file for computing shortest path please edit variable filepath (this is relative path wrt to Assignment04 directory):
std::string filepath = "../Assignment03/vg_indoor.txt";
std::string filepath = "../Assignment03/vg_small.txt";
std::string filepath = "../Assignment03/vg_large.txt";

Output of shortest path is stored in Assignment04 directory as:
shortest_indoor.txt
shortest_small.txt
shortest_large.txt

=============================================================================

Final files that you should consider while looking at our approach are:

nodeClass2.cuh
shortestPath3.cu
kernelAStar2.cuh

numbers 2 and 3 just represent new versions of my code, because I had some previous versions, but these ones mentioned above are last.

=============================================================================

Run (from Assignment04 directory):
bash compile.sh - for compilation
bash execute.sh - for execution
bash visualize.sh - for visualization of shortest path

Note: since output of execute will be truncated in terminal, you can use command:
bash execute.sh > someName.txt
This will save output of bash script to someName txt file where you can see full output if you want.

=============================================================================

In the directory Plots you can see following images:

vg_indoor - visibility graph for polygons_indoor.txt file
vg_small - visibility graph for polygons_small.txt file
vg_large - visibility graph for polygons_large.txt file
shortest_plain_indoor - shortest path for polygons_indoor.txt file (without visibility graph being ploted together with shortest path)
shortest_plain_small - shortest path for polygons_small.txt file (without visibility graph being ploted together with shortest path)
shortest_plain_large - shortest path for polygons_large.txt file (without visibility graph being ploted together with shortest path)
shortest_vg_indoor - shortest path for polygons_indoor.txt file (with visibility graph being ploted together with shortest path)
shortest_vg_small - shortest path for polygons_small.txt file (with visibility graph being ploted together with shortest path)
shortest_vg_large - shortest path for polygons_large.txt file (with visibility graph being ploted together with shortest path)
